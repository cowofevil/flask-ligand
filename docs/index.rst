Why not Use FastAPI Instead?
----------------------------

This library mimics many of the features of `FastAPI`_, well, because `FastAPI`_ is really good! However, the
:doc:`Flask <flask:index>` ecosystem is much larger than `FastAPI`_ giving many more options when it comes to high
quality extensions. The one large advantage `FastAPI`_ has over :doc:`Flask <flask:index>` currently is support for
asynchronous I/O via `Starlette`_ which can improve performance dramatically.

:doc:`Flask's asyncio journey <flask:async-await>` has just started and :doc:`Quart <quart:index>` most likely being the
future for asyncio in the :doc:`Flask <flask:index>` ecosystem. This library was inspired by FastAPI and I think anyone
considering starting a greenfield microservice should give serious consideration to using `FastAPI`_.

However, if you have an existing :doc:`Flask <flask:index>` microservice needing an upgrade in feature set then this
library brings together the best extensions that the :doc:`Flask <flask:index>` ecosystem has to offer! If you're
creating a greenfield microservice then this library lets you tap into a wide range of other
:doc:`Flask extensions <flask:extensions>` that will help you solve your problem(s) faster.
